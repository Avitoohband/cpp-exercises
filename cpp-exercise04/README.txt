Compile: g++ -Wall ex4b.cc –o ex4b

Run: ex4b

Input: 10 numbers

 with its index's value
 example:
 array[0] = 5 >>> it will go to array[5]
 display : 0 5

it will keep going till it find a loop.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex4c.cc –o ex4c

Run: ex4c

input: 10 numbers.
output: possible loop between them
 the runtime of this porgram is 2 sqaure x, when x as the size of the array.
